It has barely seen any change in the past decades. Consumers have to buy furniture the same way they did during the pre-internet era. They drive to a big furniture retail facility in the outskirts of a city. Roam the huge retail space for hours and return with a cheap, short-lasting bookshelf that they will have to replace a few years down the road.",
